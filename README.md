- Accesible over HTTPS from remote host
- All data will be stored under `/data`
- Fixed (configurable) passwords for AWX and PostgreSQL
- Fixed (configurable) versions of AWX and PostgreSQL

## Environment

- Tested on:
  - CentOS Stream 8 (Minimal)
  - K3s v1.23.6+k3s1
- Products that will be deployed:
  - AWX Operator 0.22.0
  - AWX 21.1.0
  - PostgreSQL 12

## References

- [K3s - Lightweight Kubernetes](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/)
- [INSTALL.md on ansible/awx](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/21.1.0/INSTALL.md) @21.1.0
- [README.md on ansible/awx-operator](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator/blob/0.22.0/README.md) @0.22.0

## Requirements

- **Computing resources**
  - **2 CPUs and 4 GiB RAM minimum**.
  - It's recommended to add more CPUs and RAM (like 4 CPUs and 8 GiB RAM or more) to avoid performance issue and job scheduling issue.
  - The files in this repository are configured to ignore resource requirements which specified by AWX Operator by default.
- **Storage resources**
  - At least **10 GiB for `/var/lib/rancher`** and **10 GiB for `/data`** are safe for fresh install.
  - **Both will be grown during lifetime** and **actual consumption highly depends on your environment and your usecase**, so you should to pay attention to the consumption and add more capacity if required.
  - `/var/lib/rancher` will be created and consumed by K3s and related data like container images and overlayfs.
  - `/data` will be created in this guide and used to store AWX-related databases and files.

## Deployment Instruction

### Prepare CentOS Stream 8 host

Disable Firewalld. This is [recommended by K3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/advanced/#additional-preparation-for-red-hat-centos-enterprise-linux).

```bash
sudo systemctl disable firewalld --now
```
or
```bash
systemctl disable nm-cloud-setup.service nm-cloud-setup.timer
reboot
```

Install required packages to deploy AWX Operator and AWX.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y git make
```

### Install K3s

Install K3s with `--write-kubeconfig-mode 644` to make config file (`/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`) readable by non-root user.

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --write-kubeconfig-mode 644
```

### Install AWX Operator

Install specified version of AWX Operator. Note that this procedure is applicable only for AWX Operator `0.14.0` or later. If you want to deploy `0.13.0` or earlier version of AWX Operator, refer [üìùTips: Deploy older version of AWX Operator](tips/deploy-older-operator.md).

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator.git
cd awx-operator
git checkout 0.22.0
```

Export the name of the namespace where you want to deploy AWX Operator as the environment variable `NAMESPACE` and run `make deploy`. The default namespace is `awx`.

```bash
export NAMESPACE=awx
make deploy
```

The AWX Operator will be deployed to the namespace you specified.

```bash
$ kubectl -n awx get all
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/awx-operator-controller-manager-68d787cfbd-kjfg7   2/2     Running   0          16s

NAME                                                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/awx-operator-controller-manager-metrics-service   ClusterIP   10.43.150.245   <none>        8443/TCP   16s

NAME                                              READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/awx-operator-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           16s

NAME                                                         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/awx-operator-controller-manager-68d787cfbd   1         1         1       16s
```

### Prepare required files

Clone this repository and change directory.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/kurokobo/awx-on-k3s.git
cd awx-on-k3s
```

Generate a Self-Signed certificate. Note that IP address can't be specified. If you want to use a certificate from public ACME CA such as Let's Encrypt or ZeroSSL instead of Self-Signed certificate, follow the guide on [üìÅ **Use SSL Certificate from Public ACME CA**](acme) first and come back to this step when done.

```bash
AWX_HOST="awx.example.com"
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -out ./base/tls.crt -keyout ./base/tls.key -subj "/CN=${AWX_HOST}/O=${AWX_HOST}" -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:${AWX_HOST}"
```

Modify `hostname` in `base/awx.yaml`.

```yaml
...
spec:
  ...
  ingress_type: ingress
  ingress_tls_secret: awx-secret-tls
  hostname: awx.example.com     üëàüëàüëà
...
```

Modify two `password`s in `base/kustomization.yaml`. Note that the `password` under `awx-postgres-configuration` should not contain single or double quotes (`'`, `"`) or backslashes (`\`) to avoid any issues during deployment, backup or restoration.

```yaml
...
  - name: awx-postgres-configuration
    type: Opaque
    literals:
      - host=awx-postgres
      - port=5432
      - database=awx
      - username=awx
      - password=Ansible123!     üëàüëàüëà
      - type=managed

  - name: awx-admin-password
    type: Opaque
    literals:
      - password=Ansible123!     üëàüëàüëà
...
```

Prepare directories for Persistent Volumes defined in `base/pv.yaml`. These directories will be used to store your databases and project files. Note that the size of the PVs and PVCs are specified in some of the files in this repository, but since their backends are `hostPath`, its value is just like a label and there is no actual capacity limitation.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /data/postgres
sudo mkdir -p /data/projects
sudo chmod 755 /data/postgres
sudo chown 1000:0 /data/projects
```

### Deploy AWX

Deploy AWX, this takes few minutes to complete.

```bash
kubectl apply -k base
```

To monitor the progress of the deployment, check the logs of `deployments/awx-operator-controller-manager`:

```bash
kubectl -n awx logs -f deployments/awx-operator-controller-manager -c awx-manager
```

When the deployment completes successfully, the logs end with:

```txt
$ kubectl -n awx logs -f deployments/awx-operator-controller-manager -c awx-manager
...
----- Ansible Task Status Event StdOut (awx.ansible.com/v1beta1, Kind=AWX, awx/awx) -----

localhost                  : ok=65   changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=44   rescued=0    ignored=0
```

Required objects has been deployed next to AWX Operator in `awx` namespace.

```bash
$ kubectl -n awx get awx,all,ingress,secrets

```

Now your AWX is available at `https://awx.example.com/` or the hostname you specified.

Note that you have to access via hostname that you specified in `base/awx.yaml`, instead of IP address, since this guide uses Ingress. So you should configure your DNS or `hosts` file on your client where the brower is running.

At this point, AWX can be accessed via HTTP as well as HTTPS. If you want to redirect HTTP to HTTPS, see [üìùTips: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS](tips/https-redirection.md).

## Back up and Restore AWX using AWX Operator

The AWX Operator `0.10.0` or later has the ability to back up and restore AWX in easy way.

Refer [üìÅ **Back up AWX using AWX Operator**](backup) and [üìÅ **Restore AWX using AWX Operator**](restore) for details.
